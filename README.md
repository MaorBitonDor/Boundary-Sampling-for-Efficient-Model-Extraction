## Overview

Model extraction is a crucial task in various fields such as machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature selection and model tuning, which can be time-consuming and subjective. Evolutionary algorithms offer an automated approach to this problem by iteratively evolving a population of candidate models.

This algorithm employs a genetic-inspired approach to model extraction. It begins with a population of randomly generated models and iteratively evolves them through selection, crossover, and mutation operations. By evaluating each model's fitness based on its performance on the given data set, the algorithm guides the evolution towards better solutions.

## Features

- **Automated Model Extraction:** The algorithm automates the process of model extraction, reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Users can customize various parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and selection criteria to adapt the algorithm to different data sets and tasks.
- **Scalability:** The algorithm is designed to scale to large data sets and complex model structures.
- **Extensibility:** The codebase is modular and extensible, allowing users to easily incorporate new features or optimization techniques.
